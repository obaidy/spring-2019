                <img src="/img/rocky.jpg" alt="">

                <p>While the Bootcamp programme is provides great nutrition for your brains, it does not do much for the rest of your bodies. Apart from occasional trip to the bathroom and rapid movement of fingers, we programmers don't move much. We should change that.</p>

                <p>Therefore, traditionally, there is a <strong>Running Challenge</strong> that goes together with every new class. It is open for everyone and everyone is strongly encouraged to participate.</p>

                <p>We can still be the IT guys and gals without looking like we never leave the shine of our screens.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="goal">
                <h2>Goal</h2>

                <p>The goal is to track the highest number of workouts in a run-tracking app. In other words the more you manage to leave the comfort of your chair and go running, the higher your chances of winning.</p>

                <p><strong>Optionally</strong> there can be a simultaneous challenge where we aim for the highest total distance of all the runs. If you are interested in this, let the instructor know.</p>

            <section class="howto">
                <h2>How to participate?</h2>

                <p>We need to be able to track our progress which will both motivate us and provide us with the results when the challenge is over. Therefore we need to install and use a <strong>run-tracking application</strong> on our mobile phones.</p>

                <p>There is a wide variety of free running apps and it would be useful to decide on one of them.</p>

                <p>For this batch we will use the application <strong>Endomondo</strong>. It's not as feature-full as some of the other possibilities but it has the option to create public challenges.</p>

                <p>You can register for Endomondo here: <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/">endomondo.com</a></p>

                <p>You can download the tracking application for your phone in the Google/Appstore.</p>

                <p>After registering, go to this link: <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/challenges/40250181">http://www.endomondo.com/challenges/40250181</a> and join the challenge!</p>
